# Unit Testing Best Practices

## Arrange, Act, Assert

## One Assert per Test Method

## Independent Tests

## Keep them short and visible

## Use Tests to regcognise a bad design - no hard labour on the arrage part

## Add them to the build - No execptions. Don't be lazy

## If are going to write them make them count

## Others say test when in doubt
